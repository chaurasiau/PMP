Notice that writing & analyzing full-length mock tests is as important as studying the theory. On the other hand, learning from mentorship is as important as solving practice questions.

The following table summarizes the details of each of these resources which I used for my preparation:
 
Resources	I used:
Textbooks/online courses	
Rita Mulcahy (10th Ed.) as per new 2021 format
Kim Heldman - 2021 Exam Update
Official PMBOK (6th Ed.) - YES! This is still relevant even after the 2021/22 exam update
Agile Practice Guide (APG) that comes along with PMBOK6 – Bible! Don’t skip this one
Official PMBOK 7th Edition (you definitely need to refer to a few areas from PMBOK-7)
I did not take any online theory course since I already had 35 contact hours of formal education from my MBA curriculum
Practice Qs	
Rita Mulcahy/Kim Heldman Qs at the end of each chapter along with the explanations 
My Udemy 330-Q mock exam simulator as per the new format of the PMP Exam: https://bit.ly/3mQDg3L
FREE Mock Tests + Analysis
 
(Please note here that if you take 4 hours to give a mock test, analyze your results for at least 8 hours! Analyzing a mock is more important than giving it. The direct output of your analysis is an updated error log which you keep on revisiting from time to time. I followed this strategy and it worked wonders for me!)

Mentorship	
I did not get much opportunity to explore this field to the fullest. However, I identified 2 persons (one inside and 1 outside my organization) who were PMP certified. I took some learnings from them. But both of them had got qualified 4-5 years ago so they were not able to help me much with recent structure and preparation materials.
